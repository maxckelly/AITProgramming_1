# Day 1 of Programming 
- C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1983
- 1940s was the first human readable programming language.
- 1957 first high level programming language called FORTRAN was created.
- 1983 C++ was created
- Low level programming is close to machine code, high level programming is closer to natural languages. 
- C/C++  are medium level languages.  It's a mix of both high and low. 
- Instructions are stored in the computer as binary 1 and 0.


### Steps to right basic computer program
- Step 1: identify problem 
- Step 2: Instructions in human language - PSEUDOCODE.
- Step 3: Translate the steps into C++
- Step 4: Compile the program -  use a complier to translate your program into something the computer can understand
- Step 5: Run the program: 
- Step 6: Fix or improve the program

### Coding in C++
- `<<` - This is a incerstion operator and is used to display on the console. 
- `#` - This is preprocess directive.
- `using namespace std;` - When we include this it means we don't have to add `std::` before every `cout`
- `cout` - For displaying/ printing. 
- `#include` - This is a keyword and its used to include a library.
- A library like `<iostream>` allows you to use 
- `return 0`: This means when at the end of the function we have nothing else to run, so close the function and end. 
- `<< endl`: This creates a new line.
- `/* */`: This is a multiline comment.
